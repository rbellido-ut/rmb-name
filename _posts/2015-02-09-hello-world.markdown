Huzzah! My first post on my blog. It's been three years in the making... And no, it's not because I couldn't get a simple
static site up. But you know..life and other important things get in the way. But hey! I am here now. Anyway, the site
is still pretty bare so expect some features like Archived Posts, Twitter stream, some cool animations,
and maybe when I get around to it, my second blog post.

Stay tuned and thanks for reading!
